            <h4>My name is Ryan Bowers and I am a junior studying Computer Science and Statistics & Analytics at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</h4>
             
            <h4>On campus, I'm involved with Carolina Analytics & Data Science and Computer Science + Social Good.</h4>
          
            <h4>In my free time, I like watch TV comedies and read. My current favorites are Community, and The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut, respectively.</h4>

            <h4>I'm on pace to finish seventy books in 2024. This hobby is what drove me to begin developing Paging, which will be a book-focused social media platform where users can update their followers on their progress through a book, and review it.</h4>
